# eCommerceFullStack (Per Scholas Mod 2 Project)

The focus for this Mod 2 project is the Front end aspect of my fullstack Application. This is an ecommerce application that sells travel and tour packages to various popular 
cites around the globe. This app is intended for clients who are busy and have no time do a search for a quick vacation/holiday destiantion.
This is a quick, click-and-go app that allows ease of booking and worry free booking process.
Prospective clients will hopefully be able to just a pick a travel package and checkout. Additional features will be added in the future.

The technologies used in this project is HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, React-redux, React-router, axios, and the Bootstrap library.

# Backend 
The backend is partially functioning with only one Route working for now. I am using Mongoose, Express, Nodejs, Compass and MongoDB for my database. I utilize Postman for testing my requests. I am also using DotENV for my environmental variables and Nodemon and Concurrently for my local server environment.

(This is a work in progress and will continue to be updated until fully working).
